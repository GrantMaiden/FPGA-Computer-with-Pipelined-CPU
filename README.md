# FPGA-Computer-with-Pipelined-CPU
A fully functioning computer with a pipelined CPU, developed in System Verilog.
Credit to my groupmates for considerable work on the project, Andrique Liu and Zhengjie Zhu.

This FPGA simulated CPU is developed to simulate a fully functioning computer that runs an annotated version of the ARMv8 instruction set - LEGv8. The Control system needs to be preloaded with the assembly code for a LEGv8 application. The system register, ALU, and memory modules operate on a 32bit infrastructure.
